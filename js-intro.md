# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

A function is javascript is simply a way to organize a block of code to perform a task. If the entireity of your code is a program, a function within the code is a subprogram. Functions are usefull because they allow us to perform multiple actions inside a program on mulptiple arguments.

#### 2. What is a method?

In javascript, a method is a code that is attached to an object that returns a change in the object. Many methods are preprogrammed into javascript and calling on them will perform their action. Methods can also be coded for specific actions to occur.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?

var strng = "Coding is fun!"

//Method examples
strng.indexOf('o') //Returns 0
strng.split("") //returns ['c', 'o', 'd', 'i', 'n', 'g', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', 'f', 'u', 'n']
strng.toUpperCase() //returns "CODING IS FUN!"

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?

Accessor methods return a value from an object. Mutator methods change a value of an object. For example, if we wanted to change a letter of a string, we would use a mutator method. Likewise, if we simply wanted to return a letter in a string, we would use an accessor method.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?

Console.log() is a way coders can view the outcome of their code without running through a frontend language like html. We can use the console.log() to print the outcome in our terminal or console. This makes it fast and easy to test our programs. Return must be used inside of certain code, such as a funciton, to output a value. When a function is called on, it will return whatever is in the return line. It would be common to console.log() the return when testing the function in order to see what the return is.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

I find it very beneficial to be able to have some time to work alone to figure things out. Code pairing is very good when we first learn a new topic but I also find it useful to focus on my own.
